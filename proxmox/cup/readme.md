## What is Cup?

[Cup](https://github.com/sergi0g/cup) is a lightweight container image update checker that helps identify when your Docker images have newer versions available. It supports various registries like Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io), Quay, and more â€“ all without hitting rate limits.

You can view container image update status through a simple web interface (on port **8000**) or via CLI.

## Infrastructure Overview

This setup is designed for a self-hosted homelab managed using **Proxmox**, with individual directory structures and service compositions for modularity. Here's a look at how it's organized:

```bash
proxmox/
â”œâ”€â”€ cup                         # Container update checker (Cup) setup
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ compose.yaml            # Docker Compose file for Cup agent/server
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ cup.json                # JSON config/output (structured state)
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ readme.md               # This documentation file
â”œâ”€â”€ glance
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ home.yml                # System overview dashboard config
â”œâ”€â”€ homeassistant
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ compose.yaml            # Smart home automation system
â”œâ”€â”€ media
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ compose.yaml            # Media stack (Plex/Jellyfin/Sonarr/etc)
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ qbitbot
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ config.json.template# Torrent automation configuration template
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ readme.md
â”œâ”€â”€ nginxproxymanager
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ compose.yaml            # Nginx Proxy Manager instance
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ frpc.toml               # FRP (client) config
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ frps
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ compose.yaml        # FRP (server) deployment
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ frps.toml           
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ nginx.conf
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ readme.md
â””â”€â”€ speedtest-tracker
    â”œâ”€â”€ compose.yaml            # Self-hosted internet speed monitoring
    â”œâ”€â”€ readme.md
    â””â”€â”€ sample.env.sample
```

Each subdirectory includes a `compose.yaml` file and relevant configs to deploy and manage individual services independently using Docker Compose. This provides scalability, modularity, and ease of maintenance.

## Getting Started with Cup

Create the setup using this script or manually:

### One-liner Setup Script for cup agent

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cup && cat > ~/.cup/compose.yaml <<EOF
services:
  cup:
    image: ghcr.io/sergi0g/cup:latest
    container_name: cup
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: serve
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    environment:
      - CUP_AGENT=true
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
EOF

docker compose -f ~/.cup/compose.yaml up -d
```

## Final Notes

- This infra is managed manually via Docker Compose grouped by logical services
- Cup backs the observability layer to ensure all containers are up to date
- Services are exposed and reverse-proxied using **Nginx Proxy Manager** and optionally tunneled via FRP
